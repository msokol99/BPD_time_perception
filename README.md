 ## Abstract
<p align="justify">
 This study delves into the altered perception of time in individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), leveraging advanced techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. Drawing on autobiographical texts from BPD patients, we explore the nuanced interplay between language use and the subjective experience of time. Our methodology harnesses a transformer-based architecture to analyze sentiment, word length, and frequency across these narratives, seeking correlations with time perception distortions. By comparing these linguistic patterns with those from age- and sex-matched controls, we aim to quantify differences in time perception between the groups. Initial findings suggest a distinctive temporal experience in BPD narratives, characterized by heightened entropy and reduced autocorrelation, aligning with theoretical constructs of time perception in BPD. This research not only expands our understanding of BPD's impact on time perception but also demonstrates the potential of computational approaches in psychiatric research, offering novel insights into the subjective experience of mental disorders.
